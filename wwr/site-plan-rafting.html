    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p> The purpose of this website is to attract adventure-seeking individuals and families to our whitewater rafting company. We aim to provide detailed information about our rafting trips, showcase the excitement of our experiences through engaging photos and testimonials, and make it easy for customers to book their next outdoor adventure online. The ultimate goal is to increase bookings, grow our customer base, and establish our company as a trusted leader in outdoor recreation.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> Our target customers are adventurous individuals, couples, and families aged 25–50 who are looking for unique outdoor experiences. Many are working professionals or middle-income families who value spending their weekends or vacations exploring nature and creating memorable experiences together. They are active, enjoy outdoor recreation like hiking and kayaking, and often search online for their next adventure.

        These customers want fun, safe, and guided rafting trips that are suitable for their skill level, whether they’re first-timers or seasoned rafters. Currently, they struggle to find trustworthy, well-reviewed rafting companies that clearly outline trip details, safety measures, and pricing in one place.
        
        Most of our audience will access the website via mobile devices while on the go or planning travel, but some will also use laptops or desktops during the research and booking phases. Therefore, the site must be fast, easy to navigate, and fully mobile-friendly.
